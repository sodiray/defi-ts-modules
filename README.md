# DeFi Typescript Modules

This is a simplified version of a much larger project, made simple to focus on the defi integrations so it's easier for contractors to work on.

## Testing
Run `yarn test`

## Running Scripts
If you want to run some code outside of a test put it into a script and run `yarn tsx ./src/scripts/gmx/get-candles.ts` (replace path to your script)
